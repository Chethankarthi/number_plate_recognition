This project focuses on detecting and recognizing license plates from images using Python and various libraries.

Dataset
Training Data
License Plate Detection: Contains images with annotated bounding boxes specifying the location of license plates.
License Plate Recognition: Contains images along with their corresponding plate texts.
Tools and Libraries Used
OpenCV: Used for image processing and handling.
Pandas: Utilized for data manipulation and handling CSV files.
Matplotlib: Used for visualizations and plotting.
PyTesseract: Integrated for OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract text from images.
Workflow
Data Preprocessing:

Unzipped and organized datasets using Python's zipfile module.
Converted CSV annotations to JSON for easier manipulation.
Loaded JSON data into Pandas DataFrames for further processing.
License Plate Detection:

Extracted images and corresponding bounding box coordinates.
Generated a Pandas DataFrame with image paths and bounding box coordinates.
Created a CSV file with cleaned and structured data for model training.
License Plate Recognition:

Processed JSON file to extract image IDs and corresponding text labels.
Applied OCR using PyTesseract on the images to extract license plate texts.
Data Visualization and Analysis:

Visualized the bounding boxes on images using OpenCV.
Generated summary statistics and insights from the data.
Model Training and Testing:

Split data into training and testing sets.
Used deep learning or machine learning models for training (details can be included if applicable).
File Structure
Dataset: Contains subdirectories for training and testing datasets.
Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Results
Detection Results: Visualizations showing bounding boxes on images.
Recognition Results: Extracted text from license plates.
Conclusion
Challenges: Mention any challenges faced and how they were addressed.
Future Work: Outline potential improvements or expansions for the project.
